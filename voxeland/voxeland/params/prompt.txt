You are an expert object category disambiguator. I am passing you several images that include an object. That object has
been labeled these categories: {}. I want you to analyze the images to tell me exactly which one of the previous categories
is the correct one.

Your answer must only include one of the categories I have specified and must follow the following format:
"The category is ..."

For example:
    # Example 1: "The category is refrigerator"
    # Example 2: "The category is TV"
    # Example 3: "The category is table"
